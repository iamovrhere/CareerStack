###Features

The application is designed for tablets and multiple screen sizes, both large and small. It features both dark and light themes, for easy viewing day or night. Additionally, it supports multiple locales including:

* en - English
* de - German
* es - Spanish
* fr - French
* nl - Dutch

Translations likely need some work at this point as English is my native language, with only a cursory knowledge of French from secondary/high school.
